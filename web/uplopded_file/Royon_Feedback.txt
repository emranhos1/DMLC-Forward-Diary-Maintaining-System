SHAMSULAREFEEN (7:21 PM):
1. the interface doesn't look very user-friendly
nobody is going to use it until it becomes easy for them
so far.....you haven't worked much apart from little bit modifying a template
there is no sense of workflow in the whole development
it should be a work-flow driven interface
like......creating a procurement project-->item description and specification-->uploading documents-->so on
yes i can do that
but type, length size egula user put kore poshabe na
just give them the provision to attach a excel file
excel or word file...
tahole eta keno dorkar?
then call it a purchaser account info
yea....
'admin panel' type jargon avoid koro
ora jeta bujhbe serokom naam dao
yes

na....but ekta reverse auction ekta jinish ba ekta 'package' er upor hobe jetar jonno supplier price bid korte parbe
ekta reverse auction window te A4 paper supplier r generator supplier ekshathe participate korbe na
that's impractical
it has to be single item or single package
project e paper r generator eki shathe lagar kono concept nai
dont see 'project' from customer perspective
see 'project' as procurement perspective
ekta jinish kenar beparta ekta procurement project
project er definition hocche....
a 'procurement project' is a purchasing act where the purchaser will put in the requirement of a item or a package of items which can be supplier by a single supplier entitiy (if needed the supplier can come in the form of a consortium)
supplied*
ha
right
